            <h2>Frontend Design Process</h2>
            <img src="Source/sleepycat.gif" width="100" class="sticky-gif"/>
            <p>This application really puts empahsis on the design and aesthictics of itself. The process started off with just a list of potential screens. Very base level like creating account or logging in. And other basic music screens such as a library of songs, a music player at the bottom or a screen where users can create and retrieve playlists.</p>
            <p>To bring the screens to life I decided to use Figma in order to gain new design skills and become familer with UI/UX applications.</p>
            <p>Firstly I needed a good color scheme, something unique thats pops out but isnt too overwhelming.</p>
            <div class="figma-gallery">
                <img src="Source/Colorpallete.png" width="400">
                <p></p>
            </div>
            <p>Every good app needs its mascot. with the name in mind I decided to make my cat that apps logo. (He's Orange and his names Simba). I used the PiskelApp inorder to create a pixel art of a cat and animate it into a gif.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Then comes another important factor --- the font. Based off the pixelated cartoons a made, it only makes sense to a pixelated font</p>
            <h1 class="pixel-title">Pixelify Sans Medium</h1>
            <p>After curating our skeleton, now its time to actually put together the screens. using the original list of screens I started designing all the views in Figma.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In the future using figma pays off significantly when fixing minor UI/UX objects since you just have to put in the same measurements from figma to set it up</p>

            <img src="Source/sleepycat.gif" width="100" class="sticky-gif"/>
            <p>While take Objects and Design (CS2340) class at GaTech, I was taught some important tech stacks to build my applications. I used the same one I used to create my group project from this class, Firebase. I already had some experience working with firebase so I decided to stick with it. I used the realtime database to store all the beats and firestore so users are able to curate their own playlists.</p>

            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>Because this was my first fully individual app ive built based off all that ive learned, there are some bad coding practices ive had to keep. One great example is code repitition for slightly different screens</p>
            <p>To expand this application I could use any availible AI music model and use it's API and create a way for users to create their own new beats.</p>
            <p>This application also has alot of potential to be scalable as I made sure not to hard code anything relating to data reading and writing.</p>
